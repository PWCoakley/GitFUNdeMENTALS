#  Git Init
The  `Git  Init`  command  is  used  to  make  an  empty  git  repository.
If  you wanted    to  create  a   new directory   and initialize  a   git repository,     you can do  so  with  the  following  commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```
Once  inside  a  git  repository  you  can  start  using  commands  such  as:
[status](./status.md),
[add](./add.md),
[commit](./commit),
[push](./push.md)
and more.  
Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
